<h3>My Favorite Thing</h3>
<p>My favorite thing is studying complex systems. These are systems where the individual parts are very simple, but when you get enough individual parts and put them together they display very complex behaviour. Like your brain, or ant colonies, etc.</p>
<h3>My Favorite Movie</h3>
<p>My favorite movie is Spirited Away. That is probably mostly due to nostalgia as the first time I watched this movie it was a beautiful summer day when I was a child on summer break. The movie also, still holds up and actually has many complex themes. It was made during an economic era in Japan that was interesting to say the least.</p>
